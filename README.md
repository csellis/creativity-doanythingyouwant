# Creativity App for Kids

Our aim with this application is to teach kids about programming by creating a site they can showcase their
work and also introduce newer developers to databases.

## Part of HacktoberFest 2022

We aim to share this project with the wider Open Source community. PRs are welcome that aid in a Starter Kit that kids can start their own showcase page.
